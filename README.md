# Mortgage_Calculator

## Synopsis ##
Most people know intuitively that it is generally a better idea to buy a home than to rent one, especially over an extended period of time. Building up equity in an appreciating asset is rightly seen as preferable to simply paying rent to a landlord, none of which will ever find its way back to the tenant. However, there are a lot of costs of home ownership that are not equity-building, including mortgage interest, property taxes, maintenance, home insurance, realtor fees (when selling), and more. The purpose of this application is to allow a user to compare a rent rate with a particular home financing plan (in which the key values are home value, down payment, mortgage duration, and interest rate), to see, in terms of future value of money, which option will truly be a better financial choice.

## Goal ##
The goal of the mortgage calculator be able to compare the *total cost* of home ownership (including mortgage payment, property taxes, homeowner's insurance, estimated maintenance, etc.) over a period of time in comparison to the total cost of renting during that time period. The comparison will be made between future value calculations of each scenario.
